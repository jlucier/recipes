## Ingredients
- ~3-5lbs of beef or lamb or goat
- (Mexican) oregano
- ~1tsp ground cumin
- ¼ tsp ground cinnamon
- ¼ tsp ground cloves
- ~7 dried guajillo chiles
- Passilla, chipotle, jalapeno, are also fine, mix and match
- 1 large onion, roughly chopped
- ~6 cloves of garlic, peeled
- 1” of ginger, thinly sliced
- 3 large tomatoes, cored and chopped
- 3 bay leaves
- 1 tbsp honey
- ¼ cup white vinegar
- 1 quart chicken broth

## Process
- Cut the meat into 2-3” chunks and add it to the pot you will eventually make the stew in
- Season with salt, pepper, cumin, (mexican) oregano, a bit of cinnamon, and some ground clove and toss thoroughly
- Cover the pot and leave the meat in the fridge for ~6 hours or overnight
- Prep the chiles by cutting of the stems and cutting them open with scissors, remove the seeds
- Heat up olive oil in a saucepan, add the chiles and toss in the hot oil for about 30 seconds to breathe life back into them. Then stir in the chopped onion, garlic, and ginger. Add tomatoes with ~2 cups of water and bring to a simmer. Simmer for ~30 mins.
- Remove the saucepan from the heat, and use an immersion blender or normal blender to blend the sauce smooth. Strain the sauce through a mesh strainer.
- P.S. don’t use too fine a strainer, it’ll take friggin forever.
- Remove the pot with the meat from the fridge. Add bay leaves, honey, vinegar, chicken broth, and strained chile sauce.
- Bring the stew to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 3-4 hours (until the meat is falling-apart tender. Stir occasionally.
- The original recipe says to “skim fat” as you go and reserve it for making tacos, but you do.
- Eat it as a stew, on rice, or make tacos. Garnish with lime, crema, cilantro, diced onion, whatever you like.
