## Ingredients
- ~3-5lbs of pork shoulder
- 8-12 tomatillos, cut in large chunks / halves
- 1 large onion, quartered and peeled
- 2-6 green chiles, cut in half (modulate for how hot you want it, also remove most seeds)
- Can do a mix of jalapenos, poblanos, hatch, etc.
- 1 quart of chicken stock
- 1 bunch of cilantro
- 1 ½ tbsp ground cumin
- Limes

## Process
- Put the cut tomatillos, onion, and chiles onto a sheet tray, lightly oil, and broil / roast until browned, ~10mins (if you use the broiler, maybe less)
- Transfer the roasted peppers, onions, and tomatillos into a blender, add a large handful of cilantro, and blend smooth.
- Cut the pork into 1-2” chunks and brown well on high heat in a large pot with some neutral oil.
- When the pork is almost finished browning, add cumin and stir in with pork. Cook an additional minute or two.
- Lower the heat slightly, and add the chicken stock and ~1 quart of the chile sauce to the pot, reserving any extra you may have to turn into salsa. Bring to a simmer.
- Season the leftover chile sauce with salt and lime to make a dank salsa.
- Place a lid on the pot with the lid slightly ajar, and place the pot into a 275F oven for ~3 hours or until the pork is tender and shreddable.
- Remove from the oven and you’re done.
- You may want the sauce to be thicker, in which case you can simmer the sauce and pork for a bit longer with the lid off to thicken it. Just don’t overcook the friggin thing.
- You can also skim off some fat if you don’t like being happy.
