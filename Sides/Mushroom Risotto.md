## Ingredients (½ recipe):
- 1 cup of Arborio rice (“Important, don’t fuck with other rice” - Anna)
- 2 shallots chopped
- 2 garlic cloves chopped
- 1.5 pounds of mushrooms sliced (pretty much any kind, I like baby bellas)
- ~4 tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil (+/- 1)
- 2 cups of double cream (regular heavy cream fine)
- 1 cup of Sauvignon Blanc
- 1 cup grated parm (approximate amount, more is ok, plus save some for topping)
- 2 cups vegetable/chicken stock
- Optional: chopped fresh herbs

## Cooking:
- Add olive oil to hot pan (medium-high), then add mushrooms. Let them lose most of their moisture, and brown for a few more minutes.
- Add the then garlic and shallots, sauté for a few more minutes
- Add the rice and toast for another minute or two. At this point the rice should be slightly translucent, the garlic and shallots nicely softened and sautéd, and mushrooms browned with a nice fond in the pan.
- Deglaze with the wine, reduce
- Add stock little by little, keeping risotto wet and cook for ~20 minutes stirring fairly often (usually takes more like 25-30, it’ll get thick, just believe)
- Add the cream after the first 15 mins and reduce until thickened, Add parm (and herbs), then season to taste with salt and pepper
