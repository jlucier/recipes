- Set oven to 350F. Transfer dried bread to a large mixing bowl. Grease/spray a 9x13in pan and set aside.
- In a large pan, melt 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) of butter over medium-high heat. Add onions and celery and cook until softened and just starting to brown, then transfer to the bowl with the bread.
- Add all herbs to the large bowl and season with salt and pepper. Add half of the chicken stock (1 1/4 cup) and mix thoroughly.
- In a separate bowl, add the remaining chicken stock and both eggs and whisk to combine, then add to main bowl and mix again. Turn out the mixture into your prepared baking dish.
