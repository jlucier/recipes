## Ingredients
- Big bunch of kale (dino / tuscan kale is the best)
- Roughly equal volume of brussels to kale
- Pine nuts
- Easily swapped with almonds or walnuts
- Dijon Mustard
- 1-2 Lemons
- A bunch of parmesan cheese
- Olive oil
- 2 cloves of garlic

## Process
- Start the dressing by micro-planing / finely chopping the garlic and adding it to a bowl with the juice of 1 lemon (to take the edge off the garlic).
- The dressing is gonna end up being ~30-70 lemon juice to other liquids, so just figure out how much you need based on how much dressing you're making.
- Chop for literal days… putting the resulting ribbons of kale / brussels into a big bowl.
- Remove the ribs from the kale, and cut into thin ribbons. You don’t need to go microscopic here, but ~⅛ th inch ribbons are good.
- Cut off the root ends of the brussel sprouts and cut them in half lengthwise (top-to-bottom). Discard any of the outer leaves that fall off, they tend to be a lil dirty. Take each half and cut horizontally into thin slices. The slices will fall apart into ribbons when you toss the salad.
- Have a break / beer.
- Toast the nuts by putting them in a saute pan on medium heat, stirring occasionally for ~5-10mins or lightly roasting in the oven. Remove, allow to cool, then chop semi-coarsely.
- Add ~1-2 tbsp of dijon and olive oil to the garlic and lemon juice. You know, make it a dressing. Season to taste with salt and pepper, add more mustard, do you’re thing.
- Grate a metric fuck ton of parmesan into the salad bowl, add the toasted / chopped nuts, add dressing, and toss.
- You can eat immediately, or leave the salad in the fridge for a up to a few hours before eating. The hearty greens don’t wilt, honestly it just gets better the longer it all sits together.
