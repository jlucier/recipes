## Ingredients:
- ~2 chicken leg quarters or 4+ thighs (bone-in)
- ~4 sausages (cajun vibes, or just whatever)
- ½ cup of high smoke point oil
- ½ cup flour
- 2 cup of rice of your choosing
- 6 cups of chicken stock
- 1-2 red bell pepper
- ~2-3 stalks of celery
- 1 cayenne or other hot pepper
- Lots of garlic
- Some green onions
- Butter

## Cooking:
- Season chicken leg quarters with salt and pepper, brown well in dutch oven or large pan
- Brown sausage as well
- While meat is browning, dice all vegetables, crush garlic
- Make the roux (don’t walk away from the roux!)
- Get the oil smoking in the pan, add the flour
- Stir continuously until it’s “hershey’s chocolate” color
- Add all the vegetables into the hot roux, and caramelize for a few minutes (this will happen pretty fast, roux is napalm)
- Add chicken stock, a little salt + pepper, and bring to a simmer. Let it cook out for an hour uncovered
- Slice the cooked sausage into coins, and add sliced sausage, chicken quarters, and rice to the pot
- Place in a 375 degree oven for 30 minutes (or until the rice is cooked)
- Remove from the oven, add a few tablespoons of butter to make it “fucked up” delicious, garnish with green onions or some fresh herbs
