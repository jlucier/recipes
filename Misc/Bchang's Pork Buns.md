## Ingredients (yields about 20 buns):
- 1/2 tsp Salt
- 3 cups flour
- 1/4 tsp white sugar
- 1 1/8 tsp active dry yeast (or half a packet of Fleischmann's)
- 1 bunch chopped scallions
- 1 lb ground pork (70/30, or 80/20 mix with addition of ~1 tbsp lard)
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 1/2 tsp sesame seeds (optional)

## Dough:
- Bloom yeast with sugar and ~1/4 cup of warm water, approx. 10 mins
- Once bubbles appear, incorporate 1 cup of flour into yeast mixture and 1/2-3/4 cup water to make a paste (should be the consistency of cake batter)
- Cover paste with an additional cup of flour (dust over top), wrap with seran, and leave out or in oven with the light on to prove until cracks appear in the flour covering the paste, approx 15 - 30 mins
- Once cracks appear, incorporate the flour that is covering the paste along with 1 tsp of salt, creating the beginnings of the dough
- Continue working the dough, adding the remaining flour little by little, until the dough pulls away from the sides of the bowl cleanly (the dough will still be very wet/tacky at this point)
- Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface, and being to knead
- Knead the dough and periodically stretch it out, adding small amounts of the remaining flour as needed, until the dough is soft and pulls away cleanly from the work surface and your hands (the dough will be soft with a "rough" exterior that resembles the moon, and when poked it will rebound slightly but have a clear impression)
- Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl and prove for 3-4 hours in a warm place (i.e. the oven with the light on) or overnight in the fridge, until approximately doubled in size
- When ready to make buns, remove dough from fridge and allow it to return to room temperature

## Filling:
- Combine ground pork and extra pork fat (if using) in a large, preferably clear, mixing bowl, and mix to combine
- With chopsticks or a fork, further mix the pork mixture, periodically incorporating small amounts of water, essentially emulsifying the mixture
- Stop mixing/adding water when water begins to pool at the bottom of the bowl (or side when tilted)
- The pork mix should be homogenized and slightly lightened in color, about as thick as toothpaste
- Mix in ~3 tbsp of soy sauce, ~1/2 tsp salt, scallions, and other seasonings if desired (garlic, ginger, etc), and adjust the seasoning to taste
- The mixture should be well -- if not heavily -- seasoned, as the filling brings most of the seasoning for the final bun
- Microwave small portions of the mixture in order to taste if you don’t like raw pork, Chinese grandmothers will make fun of you
- Cover and place in fridge until ready to use

## Making the buns (just pull this up on youtube or have a Chinese friend show you):
- Portion dough into slightly-smaller-than-golf-ball balls
- Roll the ball of dough into a circle, approx. ¼ inch thick, leaving the center slightly thicker than the edges
- Pick up the rolled dough, cradling between your thumb and index finger of your non-dominant hand
- Spoon a heaping tablespoon of the pork filling into the center of the rolled dough and begin wrapping
- To wrap, grab the edge of the dough, stretch slightly, and pull onto the pork mixture
- Moving around the edge of the dough, grab another point along the dough edge, stretch and pull onto the previous fold, pinching them together
- Repeat, working around the circumference of the dough and moving up around the filling gradually enclosing it, pressing the pork filling down slightly with a wet finger as needed
- It is fine to go around more than once, repeating the same process until the filling is entirely enclosed
- When the dough is almost sealed around the filling, either continue pleating or pinch together to seal
- Place seam side down on a lightly oiled tray
- Repeat until out of filling or dough, get creative with whatever leftovers you have (this dough makes good scallion pancakes, filling is just good)
- Allow buns to prove once more for ~15 mins
- Either freeze or cook the buns

## Cooking:
- Heat a pan with a lid over medium to medium-high heat
- Lightly oil the pan, then arrange buns seam side down in the pan, frying lightly for 3 minutes
- Pour water into the pan until water comes up ~ ¼ of the way up the buns’ sides
- Cover the pan and cook the buns until the water has boiled off or ~5 mins have elapsed
- Remove the lid and allow any remaining water to boil off
- Continue to fry the buns until the bottoms are well browned, then remove from the pan and serve

## Sauce:
- Freestyle: spicy, salty, fresh
