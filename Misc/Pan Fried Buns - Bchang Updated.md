# Dough

Pan-fried buns are made with a twice-proofed dough, however the dough is not allowed to fully double on the first rise (hence "half-proofed"). I prefer to use a Chinese "sourdough", however this approach requires 2 days to prepare. I've also listed instructions for the faster, non-sourdough approach. In either case, my guess is that the ideal dough is about 55-60% hydration but I haven't measured it. The dough should feel soft and should be easy to knead and work with, otherwise the dough will likely be too tough and chewy.

## Sourdough Approach

### Ingredients:
- Two measurements of 1 1/2 cups AP flour (total of 3 cups)
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp white sugar
- 1/4 tsp active dry yeast
- Three measurements of water in 3/4 cup, 1/2 cup, and 1/4 cup (total of 1 1/2 cups)

### Instructions:
1. Combine the yeast, sugar, and 1/4 cup of water and wait until bubbly (about 5-10 minutes).
2. Combine one measurement of flour with the yeast mixture and 1/2 cup of water and knead until the dough is homogenous. There is no need to achieve a certain level of gluten development.
3. See this video for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y2WhnOy6rgI
4. Proof the dough for 1-2 hours, then refrigerate the dough for 1 1/2 to 2 days.
5. After the dough is refrigerated, take it out and let sit at room temperature while making the second dough.
6. Boil 3/4 cup of water and combine with the second measurement of flour and the salt. Mix the dough with a utensil until all the water is absorbed. Once the dough is cool enough to handle, knead until the dough is homogenous. Again, there is no need to achieve a certain level of gluten development at this point.
7. Tear the yeasted dough into small pieces and add to the second dough. Now knead the doughs together until homogenous and the dough springs back immediately. The dough should feel soft and may be tacky at first but it should not stick to your hands or the work surface once the gluten is developed. Adjust with small amounts of water and flour as needed. The surface may appear slightly bumpy but it should not have large tears when kneading. After pressing with a finger, the dough should immediately spring back about 75-80% at the indentation site.
8. Place in a lightly oiled bowl and proof the dough for 1-2 hours or until about 1.5x in size.

### Notes:
A small portion of the dough may be reserved and frozen for use next time. The dough should be good for about 3 weeks in the freezer, although I haven't tested this method. If using pre-made dough, simply skip making the yeasted dough and only make the hot water dough. Then, follow steps 6 and 7 with the defrosted yeasted dough. However, depending on the ratio of premade/frozen yeasted dough to hot water dough, it may be desirable to fortify the hot water dough with additional yeast. In this case, reserve a portion of water to prove the yeast and boil the remaining water. Then add the hot water to the dough and mix until absorbed but do not knead. Once cool enough to handle (or cool enough to not kill the yeast), add the yeast mixture and then knead, and finally proceed with steps 6 and 7. Also, proofing time for the final dough may take longer if only using premade/frozen yeasted dough (potentially up to a full day).

## Regular Approach

### Ingredients:
- 3 cups AP flour
- 1/2 tsp salt
- 1/4 tsp white sugar
- 1 tsp active dry yeast
- Two measurements of water in 1 cup and 1/2 cup

### Instructions:
1. Combine the yeast, sugar, and 1/2 cup of water and wait until bubbly (about 5-10 minutes).
2. Boil 1 cup of water and combine with the flour and the salt. Mix with a utensil until the water is absorbed but do not knead.
3. Once the dough is cool enough to handle (or cool enough to not kill the yeast), add the yeast mixture and knead until homogenous and the dough springs back immediately. The dough should feel soft and may be tacky at first but it should not stick to your hands or the work surface once the gluten is developed. Adjust with small amounts of water and flour as needed. The surface may appear slightly bumpy but it should not have large tears when kneading. After pressing with a finger, the dough should immediately spring back about 75-80% at the indentation site.
4. Place in a lightly oiled bowl and proof the dough for 1-2 hours or until about 1.5x in size.

### Notes:
This dough can also be used for regular steam buns. In this case, simply use all room temperature/tap water instead of boiled water. Additionally, this same dough can also be used for dumplings by omitting the yeast. For pan-fried dumplings/potstickers, use boiled water. For boiled/steamed dumplings, use room temperature/tap water.

# Filling
The buns can be made with any filling. The traditional filling is pork, although often fortified with some type of vegetable. Shanghai is also known for their vegetarian fillings. There are also seafood fillings as well as "modern"/non-traditional fillings of mapo tofu and even dessert buns made with custards or chocolate.

## Pork Filling

### Ingredients (see notes):
- 1/2 lb ground pork
- 1/4 head of a small green cabbage
- 1/2 bunch of scallions
- 1 tsp ginger
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp rice wine (both clear and shaoxing work, or leave it out if you can't find it)
- 2 tbsp soy sauce
- 2 tbsp neutral oil
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- 1/4 cup water
- 1 pint of gelatinized broth (optional but recommended)

###  Instructions:
1. Mince the ginger and the white part of the scallions and combine with 1/4 cup of water. Leave to sit for 5-10 minutes until infused. Alternatively, squeeze the minced ginger in the water to release the ginger juices. Or, blend/pulse the ginger and water in a food processor or blender until minced.
2. Mince or small dice the cabbage. This may also be done in a food processor. Then, mix the cabbage with the sesame oil.
3. Combine the pork, salt, and ginger mixture and stir until the pork begins to emulsify. Be sure to only stir in a single direction. The pork will begin to appear "stringy" and the fat will appear more streaky. The mixture will look more homogenous and should leave a film on the side of the bowl. This should take about 20-30 revolutions.
4. Add the soy sauce and rice wine to the pork mixture and mix to combine, continuing to stir in a single direction.
5. Add the cabbage and sesame oil mixture into the pork and mix to combine.
6. Slice the scallion greens into rounds and set on top of the pork mixture but do not mix in yet.
7. Heat up the neutral oil until smoking and then pour over the scallions. The oil may splatter and bubble. Then, mix in the scallions and scallion oil until combined.
8. Cook/microwave a small amount of filling and adjust the seasoning as needed. The mixture should be well- but not over-seasoned.
9. Dice the gelatinized broth or break up with a fork into 1/4 to 1/2 inch chunks and gently combine with the pork mixture.
10. Refrigerate the filling for 20-30 minutes.

### Notes:

The pork filling is very adjustable. Aside from aromatics, the pork filling may consist of only pork and no vegetables if desired. If using vegetables, ideally use an equal amount by volume of vegetables. The best vegetables to use are crunchy, leafy greens, such as green cabbage, napa cabbage, or bok choy. Other vegetables like carrots or (daikon) radish may also be used, but these should be minced to ensure the filling is smooth. The treatment of the vegetables listed in the recipe is very simple but the primary objective is to avoid any excess liquid from leaking out and making the wrapper soggy. Another approach is to fry the minced vegetables with the aromatics for more pronounced flavor (see the vegetable filling recipe for more details).

For ground pork, the best option is to buy a whole cut and grind it yourself. The best cuts to use are pork shoulder and pork belly. If the cut comes with pork skin, the skin portion can be removed and boiled for approximately 3 hours until very soft. Then, the skin can be diced and added to the pork mixture. Or, the skin could even be blended with a small amount of water until completely smooth and that mixture can be refrigerated until set into a stiff jelly which can be diced and added to the pork mixture. The addition of the gelatinized broth and/or pork skin jelly makes this filling also suitable for soup dumplings, but note that these use a non-yeasted wrapper (same dough as for steamed/boiled dumplings).

## Vegetarian Filling

### Ingredients:
- 1 lb shanghai choy or baby bok choy
- 1 cup dried vermicelli noodles
- 5-6 dried shiitakes (or about 1/4 cup dried)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1 tbsp ginger
- 2 garlic cloves
- 2 tbsp neutral oil
- 1 tsp sesame oil

### Instructions:
1. Wash the dried mushrooms and then hydrate them in boiling water.
2. Hydrate the vermicelli noodles in boiling water.
3. Blanch the bok choy in boiling salted water until soft (the roots should be toothsome/al dente but not crunchy).
4. Mince the bok choy, then mince the ginger and the garlic, then slice off the stems of the hydrated mushrooms and mince the caps, and then mince the hydrated noodles. All the mincing can be done in a food processor (except for the noodles) but the ingredients should be kept separate. The easiest way to mince the noodles is to cut them with scissors while they are still in water and then strain the cut noodles. Alternatively, the noodles can also be chopped with a knife (just do one pass).
5. Fry the minced ginger and garlic in the neutral oil until fragrant. Then add the mushrooms and stir fry for about 30 seconds. Then add in the bok choy and the salt and stir fry until the excess liquid has evaporated. Turn off the heat and then mix in the noodles.

### Notes:
I'm not sure if this filling yields the same amount as the pork filling. All of this filling can be adjusted to taste and the measurements are purely a guess, but the ingredients are what I've previously used. Tofu can also be added to this mixture, just be sure to stir fry until the excess liquid has evaporated.

# Making the Buns

## Ingredients:
- Neutral oil for pan-frying 
- Scallion greens and sesame seeds for garnish (optional)

## Instructions:
1. Using your hands, shape the bun dough into a log about 1 1/2 inches thick in diameter. If needed, portion the dough into smaller pieces to keep things manageable, just keep the other pieces covered so that they don't dry out.
2. Cut the log into slightly-larger-than-golf-ball sized pieces (about 1 inch wide). Press each piece down with your palm to flatten. Lightly flour as needed to keep the dough from sticking to the work surface. If the dough is properly hydrated, it should not need any excess flour but it's better for the dough to be tacky/slightly too wet than to be too dry.
3. Working in order of the dough piece that was least recently worked (i.e. starting with the first dough ball to be flattened), roll out the dough ball into a disk slightly larger than the size of your palm (approximately 3 1/2 to 4 inches in diameter). The center circle (about 1 to 1 1/2 inches in diameter) should be thicker (maybe 1/8 inch) while the edges should be relatively thin (maybe 1/16 inch).
4. The best way to do this is to roll out the flattened disk a few times with the rolling pin to get it to about 1/8 thick (should take about 2-3 passes). Then, holding the dough from the center with your non-dominant hand (thumb on one side and four fingers on the other), roll the edges of the disk with the rolling pin with your dominant hand while rotating the disk after each pass. See this video for reference: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GKBHd1GGhx4
5. The dough may retract a bit when rolling but it should largely keep shape if it is properly hydrated. If it is too dry, it will likely pull back significantly. In this case, there isn't much to salvage the texture of the dough, but it should still be able to be rolled out either with more pressure from the rolling pin or with an additional rest (about 15 min).
6. Place the disk of dough into the palm of your non-dominant hand. Place a slightly-heaping tablespoon of filling onto the center of the disk, trying to keep the filling on the thicker portion of the dough. Then, pleat the edges of the bun by using the thumb and index finger of your dominant hand: the thumb should be on the "inside" of the dough and the index finger will be on the "outside" of the dough. The index finger should push the next segment of dough onto the segment supported by the thumb to create the pleat. The thumb of the non-dominant hand should be used to tamp the filling to keep it from reaching the edges of the dough.
7. Try not to overfill: although excess filling can be removed, sometimes the liquid from the filling may come in contact with the edges of the dough and will prevent them from sealing.
8. If the dough is pulling back a lot, it may be necessary to stretch the edges of the dough when pleating. If the dough is not pulling back, try to avoid stretching the edges so as to keep a consistent thickness all around the bun and to avoid making weak spots on the dough where it might tear.
9. If any of the buns tear when pleating, sometimes it's too difficult to fix so I just flip them and place them pleated-side down. It works just the same.
10. See these videos for reference (I prefer the second one but the first one is easier to follow): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dMVOQ2CW2n4, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CIsmcxkZdVw
11. Place the pleated bun on a lightly floured surface and leave to proof until puffy (they will be either visibly puffy or they will leave an indentation when lightly pressed). Repeat step 4 with the rest of the dough/filling.
12. At this point, buns can also be stored in the freezer if not cooking immediately.
13. Once all the buns are puffy (probably anywhere from 30 min to 1 hr), they are ready to fry. Heat up some oil in a skillet (non-stick or cast-iron work nicely here) and fry the bottoms of the buns until golden. Then, add water (about 1/3 of the way up the sides of the buns) and cover, cooking in the same method as potstickers. After the buns have steamed (approximately 5-7 minutes), remove the cover and allow the remaining water to evaporate and the buns to crisp again on the bottoms.
14. Turn off the heat and scatter sesame seeds and scallion greens for garnish. Plate and serve with dipping sauce if desired.

# Dipping Sauce
Generally the buns don't need any dipping sauce, however there's no reason not to include one! There are various sauces that could be used, but sour flavors are definitely recommended to cut through the richness of the buns. The traditional sauce used with soup dumplings would work nicely here: julienned ginger, one part soy sauce, and two to three parts vinegar (ideally black vinegar but rice vinegar would also work, or honestly any other vinegar would probably also be fine, worcestershire sauce might also work).
